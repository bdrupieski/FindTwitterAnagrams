This is a small Scala app that finds anagrams in a sample of the Twitter firehose.

To use this, rename \_twitterapi.conf to twitterapi.conf and insert your own API keys.

I wrote a post about the initial process of finding a way to score anagrams [here](http://blog.briandrupieski.com/finding-anagrams-on-twitter/).

I ported this project to Java and continued work on it in [this repository](https://github.com/bdrupieski/AnagramFinder).
